## Modus Operandi

I am a confident Engineer specialising in IoT product development. I get excited when working with products at conception but also possess the experience and skill to move from prototype to production, considering the full spectrum of product requirements from Firmware, to App & Cloud and right through to HMI and UX. I am equally comfortable deep in the code, developing requirements, motivating and directing a team or standing in front of a customer. This is backed up by 12 years of technical experience in small teams, with recent examples of leading, mentoring and overall product ownership.

## Occupation History

### Dyson
`2020-2021`
__Associate Principal Embedded Connectivity Engineer__, Bristol
<br>
`2017-2020`
__Senior Embedded Connectivity Engineer__, Bristol

Currently, I am a senior member of the New Product Software Team at Dyson. In this role, I take ideas for connected hardware from research through to prototype, while simultaneously developing the company's connected vision / strategy.

This involves working with connected technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy, WiFi and some Mesh/Cellular Technologies across multiple vendor platforms, mainly in Python and C, to define, architect and develop new product features for connected devices so that they can be user-trialled, refined and eventually handed over to delivery teams to be put into production. These embedded prototypes interface with not only cloud platforms and mobile devices, but often with each other, and as such this role has allowed me to become quite expert in M2M/IoT protocols and technologies, such as BLE GATT, MQTT & CoAP, while also utilising my past embedded experience.

My role also requires me to be a Tech Lead in the team and this involves working closely with both technical and non-technical people to ensure that product features and requirements are shaped within the confines of available technology, and to this point, I would often operate as a Systems Engineer / Product Owner to assist in bringing a proposition to realisation, sometimes directing a team of engineers to do so. I also started the use of SCRUM in our team in 2017 which has since evolved into SAFE, all operated within the JIRA framework.

This role also requires that I carry out research into new technologies and concepts, and to date, this has allowed me to explore such things as mesh technologies (Thread, Bluetooth Mesh), BlueZ (the ever evolving Linux Bluetooth Stack), LPWAN (LTE-M, NB-IoT), Smart Home and Docker on Embedded Linux platforms. 

<br>
`2016-2017`
__Advanced Firmware Engineer__, Malmesbury

In this role, I worked as part of the team developing a robust robotics platform for current and future Dyson products, built in C, on ARM using μC/OS. My role was to develop and maintain all serial communication links between higher level platforms and lower level peripherals which meant both middleware and protocol design. This ultimately led to the adoption of a company wide serial communications protocol, which I led the development on, that is now in most new products.   

I also built lots of peripheral emulators in Python using PyQT and these went on to be widely used and adapted across the embedded teams.

### Brewbot
`2015-2016`
__Firmware Lead__, Belfast

In this role, I was Firmware Team Leader (3 members) and sole Firmware "Owner" for a Seed Funded startup based in San Francisco & Belfast. We developed an internet connected, automated brewery, going from paper-based idea to fully shippable product in 13 months.

The entire product firmware was developed in C++ on Particle's WiFi Platform (STM32 ARM Cortex M3 with Broadcom Wi-Fi chip). The firmware controlled and automated the entire brewing process on the Brewbot machine and interfaced with all on board sensors and actuators (Temperature, Flow, Load Cells). The system also communicated with a Cloud Platform (MQTT) and mobile devices (CoAP).

I also maintained the continuous integration build system (written in Python) and managed the team's workload, releases and milestones (_vaguely_ SCRUM).

Additionally, I ran a nano-brewery from our 200L pilot kit, shipping 10 kegs a week!

### Sensata
`2014 - 2015`
__Firmware Engineer__, Belfast

My time at Sensata was spent in their Automotive Innovation Team working on a series of novel Fluid Level Sensing technologies for a new Audi platform. These were developed on 8-bit, 8051 MCUs and developed in MISRA C. 

During my time at Sensata, I worked with 3 other Engineers to take a product from prototype stage to production floor, implementing all product features (RF based liquid level sensing), a debug interface (1-Wire), an MCU Bootloader & ECU Communications (_J2716 SENT_). I also developed testing tools for Windows in C++ Qt to aid in testing and calibration development. 

As this was a small team, my role had a significant amount of global customer interaction, where I had to distil technical decisions into coherent presentations.

### NYSE Euronext
`2013 - 2014`
__Platform Software Engineer__, Belfast

As a member of the Platform Team, I focused on development and maintenance of the companies Data Fabric product. Data Fabric is a high performance, low latency, message-oriented middleware platform used to distribute large volumes of application level information. It is a multi-threaded middleware for Linux Systems, written in C, that operates on typically available IP network hardware. It could leverage Infiniband hardware/networks to implement RDMA, Kernel Bypass solutions. 

My role was to implement robust, production ready C code for regular patches & new features while also managing the Data Fabric Lab and triaging Customer issues. I also developed Python tools to assist support, development and QA.

### Schrader Electronics
`2009 - 2013`
__Embedded Software Engineer__, Belfast

As a member of the "New Products Group" at Schrader, my job was to design, prototype and develop Firmware (in C) for various industrial sensing solutions, all based around an SiLabs 8051 8-bit MCU, often taking concepts from breadboard to in-situ prototype. All sensors were bare-metal solutions with a core focus on low-power design on small footprint, <64kB. The sensors communicated with base stations via 433MHz Manchester-Coded RF.

## Hobbies & Interests

I am an avid Home Brewer and I run the Homebrew Collab Brewing Club in Bristol where I encourage Home Brewers to come together to share knowledge, techniques and advice (and beer!). Like most technology minded people, I like to marry my job with my hobby and have recently developed a 3G connected, temperature controlled fermentation chamber in my shed.

I am also a multi-genre music fan and like to attend as many gigs as I can afford.
